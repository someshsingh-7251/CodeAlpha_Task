## ✅ TASK 1: Credit Scoring Model

**🔍 Objective:** Predict an individual's **creditworthiness** based on their financial history.

**🧠 Approach:**  
Classification algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forest**.

**📌 Highlights:**
- Feature engineering on credit data.
- Evaluation metrics: **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, **ROC-AUC**.
- Dataset includes income, payment history, debts, and credit score.

## ✅ TASK 2: Emotion Recognition from Speech

**🔍 Objective:** Detect **human emotions** like happy, sad, and angry from audio speech.

**🧠 Approach:**  
Utilizes **MFCC feature extraction** and **deep learning** models like **CNN/RNN**.

**📌 Highlights:**
- Preprocessing audio files and extracting MFCC features.
- Emotion classification using labeled audio data.
- Datasets like **RAVDESS**, **TESS** used.
